## Feel at ease while learning at Centre Stage as our experienced instructors are qualified professionals with Degree Holders from Universities or Diploma qualifications from the Associated Board of Royal School of Music or Trinity College, London.

## At Centre Stage, we understand that it is often a "good match" between student and teacher relationship that will develop the student's interest in learning. That is why we offer a free trial lesson to new students to see if our instructors are what you are looking for.
