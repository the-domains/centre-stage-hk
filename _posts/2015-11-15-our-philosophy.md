**OUR PHILOSOPHY**

01/ FOUNDATIONS

In terms of music education, as a leading music centre in Hong Kong, Centre Stage emphasizes the importance of the foundations in posture and technique. It is hoped that through the basics, students will be able master their instruments quicker and easier, thus making music much more enjoyable and as their past-time for life.

本學院的課程一律由淺入深，著重音樂演奏和表演技功的同時，更強調學生的基本功。為使學生建立良好的基礎，我們會教授學生正確的姿勢和手法，確保他們能純熟而精確地操控所屬樂器，從中感受樂器演奏帶來的無窮樂趣。

02/ PERFORMANCES

Music is to be performed and there is a strong focus in music performance as a learning platform where student concerts and recital workshops are held by Centre Stage periodically. Students will be able to learn how to collaborate with other musicians as well as improving on their playing techniques and gain more stage performance experiences.

匯中音樂學院更為學生提供一個音樂交流的平台，定期舉辦多個演奏會及表現研討會。演奏會的目的旨在讓學生進行互動交流，從中學習不同的知識和技巧。更重要的是，我們希望學生能從演奏中逐步建立個人自信；參與活動後，亦能學懂以不同的角度和方式欣賞他人及為日後音樂事業的發展打下穩健的根基。

03/ THE FUTURE

We aim at bringing in new ideas in teaching that are in sync with the ever changing society.  Centre Stage hope to introduce more instrumental courses as well as expanding on our current facilities in the near future.  

在不斷變遷的社會趨勢下，匯中音樂學院務求帶給學生新資訊及學習方式。我們希望在不久的將來能夠擴充現有的設施及提供更多完化的音樂課程。
